# Algorithms, 4th Edition Exercises

This repository is a collection of problems I found interesting or challenging from the [booksite](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) that accompanies the book *Algorithms, 4th Edition* by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

## Introduction
After completing the courses *Algorithms, Part I* and *Algorithms, Part II* on Coursera, I wanted to do practice problems as a way to practice algorithms and retain what I learned. These are my personal attempts at the exericses.  

## Structure
The directories and subdirectories correspond to the main and sub-sections of the content on the booksite. 
Each subsection can have up to three types of exerises:
1. Exercises
2. Creative Exercises
3. Web Exercises

The files are named as the exercise type followed by the exercise number.
However, some file names are specified by the exercise itself or named appropriately according to the data structure / algorithm they contain, such as 'NonrecursiveBST.java'. In this case, the exercise number can be found at the top of the file as a comment.

Additionally, there are files of data structures of algorithms that I try to implement from scratch.
